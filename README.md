# Kanban Board - React + Vite  

This is a **Kanban Board** built using **React** and **Vite**, focusing on performance, scalability, and best practices. This project is a lightweight and high-performance Kanban Board built using React and Vite, designed for seamless task management with a smooth drag-and-drop experience. It utilizes React Beautiful DnD for intuitive and efficient drag-and-drop functionality, ensuring a dynamic user experience.
To enhance realism, I integrated JSONPlaceholder for API-based task management, improving my understanding of state management, API handling, and UI optimization. Through this project, I refined my skills in React Hooks, Context API, and frontend performance optimization while ensuring a clean and scalable architecture.
This hands-on experience has strengthened my ability to develop efficient, real-world web applications with modern development tools.
